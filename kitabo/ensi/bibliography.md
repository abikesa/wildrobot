_Resources, Needs, Costs, Supply, Demand_. Everyone is talking about "Chinese efficiency" but the reality is more like "American corporate inefficiency". What mattered most to Big Tech was not the AI product itself, but the fact that it kept their wallstreet ponzi scheme going. The skyrocketing stocks, the billions in government funds, the gradual tech dystopia they were creating. Those were the features, not the flaws and bugs.
