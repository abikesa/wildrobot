_Geopolitics: Resources, Needs, Costs, Supply, Demand_. Everyone is talking about "Chinese efficiency" but the reality is more like "American corporate inefficiency".

The skyrocketing stocks, the billions in government funds, the gradual tech dystopia they were creating. Those were the features, not the flaws and bugs.
